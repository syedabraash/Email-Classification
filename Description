# üìß Email Classification AI Model

Welcome to the **Email Classification AI Model** repository! This project is designed to help you understand and build a robust machine learning model for classifying emails into different categories, such as "Spam" and "Not Spam." Using basic yet powerful techniques, this project guides you through the end-to-end process of developing an AI model from scratch, providing a hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and real-time prediction.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop an email classification system that can automatically categorize emails using machine learning. This system can be a critical tool for reducing the clutter in your inbox, enhancing productivity, and improving your overall email management experience.

### Key Features:

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** 
  - Learn how to collect and preprocess email data, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction using TF-IDF.
  
- **Model Training:**
  - Implement a Naive Bayes classifier, a powerful yet simple algorithm well-suited for text classification tasks. Understand the principles behind it and how it can be leveraged for spam detection.

- **Evaluation & Performance Metrics:**
  - Evaluate your model using key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to ensure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

- **Real-Time Email Classification:**
  - Deploy the model in a real-time environment where you can input new email texts and get instant predictions on whether they are spam or not.

- **Interactive Notebook:**
  - The entire project is implemented in a Colab notebook (Google Colab), making it easy to follow, modify, and experiment with the code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3:** The programming language of choice for implementing the model and handling data.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For implementing the machine learning model and evaluating its performance.
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer:** For converting text data into numerical features.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier:** The primary algorithm used for classifying emails.
- **Google Colab:** The cloud-based environment used to write and run the code, making it accessible to anyone with a Google account.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The project uses the **Spam email classification**, a popular dataset available on Kaggle, which contains a collection of email messages labeled as "spam" or "ham" (not spam). Although initially designed for Email spam detection, the techniques and models can be easily adapted for email classification.

## üìà How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-classification-ai.git
   cd email-classification-ai
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Open the provided notebook in Google Colab or your local environment.
   - Follow the step-by-step instructions to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.

3. **Real-Time Predictions:**
   - After training the model, use the provided functions to input real-time email texts and classify them as "Spam" or "Not Spam."
